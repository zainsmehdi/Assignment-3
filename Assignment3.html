             <br> A DoS attack is characterized by using a single computer to launch the attack.

            <br>Countermeasures against clickjacking include employing frame-busting scripts, implementing X-Frame-Options headers, and ensuring strict content security policies to prevent malicious embedding of website content.

            <br>To mitigate CSRF attacks, web applications often employ techniques such as anti-CSRF tokens, which verify the authenticity of requests, ensuring they originated from the legitimate user session.
